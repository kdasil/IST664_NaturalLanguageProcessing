# IST664 Natural Language Processing

## Course Description
This course is designed to develop an understanding of how natural language processing (NLP) can process written text and produce a linguistic analysis that can be used in other applications. This goal will be achieved by:
- Readings, lectures, and class discussions of the multiple levels of linguistic analysis required for a computer to accept natural language input, interpret it, and carry out a particular application.
- Lab exercises and assignments in using some of the computational techniques required to perform these levels of natural language processing of text.
- Studies of real-world applications that incorporate substantive NLP modules.

The course primarily covers the techniques of NLP in the levels of linguistic analysis, going through tokenization, wordÂ­level semantics, part-of-speech tagging, syntax, semantics, and on up to the discourse level. It also includes the use of the NLP techniques, such as information retrieval, question answering, sentiment analysis, summarization, and dialogue systems, in applications.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of the course the student will be able to:
- Demonstrate the levels of linguistic analysis, the computational techniques used to understand text at each level, and what the challenges are for those techniques.
- Process text through the language levels using the resources of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and some rudimentary use of the programming language Python.
- Describe how NLP is used in many types of real-world applications.
